# Social Network API

## Description

This project is about creating an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. This was a great way for me to practice handling and using a noSQL database which in this case was MongoDB.

## Installation

- Have Nodejs installed (I used v16.18)
- Install npm dependencies
  - use 'npm install' on terminal once navigated to folder
- Have mongoDB installed

## Usage

Navigate to the root director of the project in your terminal and install the dependencies with 'npm i' then start the server with npm start. The application should be fully running and you can test the api endpoints with your choice of program. I used [insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for testing purposes. You can see a video of me testing the application's endpoints in action [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VP0MTpCbO5bhruJq4P3BPLD3z5S2xzkr/view).
